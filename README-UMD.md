# QuickSearch UMD-Fork

This repository is a forked version of the NSCU QuickSearch repository,
incorporating UMD-specific changes.

## Changes to NCSU QuickSearch functionality

### Best Bets do not fade out

Modified the "app/assets/javascripts/quick_search/quicksearch.js" file so that
the Best Bets label remains displayed, instead of fading out after a few
seconds.
